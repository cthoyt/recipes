The recipe for Rose burgers comes from my armenian great-grandmother,
Rose Solokian, who escaped the Armenian genocide in the early 1900's and
found her way to USA. We also more commonly call these Nama burgers because
nama is what our family traditionally calls our grandmother, though I'm not
quite sure if this was a regional word for the Solokians or if it slipped into
our family vernacular because of the travels of our Armenian ancestors.

meat alternative, and still tastes great!

2. Make patties and keep in the refrigerator until ready to cook.
3. Only turn once on the grill.
