## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups flour
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 sticks (½ lb) unsalted butter, softened
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 tsp pure vanilla extract
- About 6 tbsp of preferred jam/preserves (or however much you like)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350℉ with rack in middle.
2. Make dough: Whisk together flour and salt.
3. Beat butter and sugar with an electric mixer until very pale and fluffy,
   about 4 minutes, then beat in egg and vanilla.
4. At low speed, mix in flour mixture in 3 batches, just until a dough forms.
5. Divide dough in half and form each piece into a 6-in disc, then chill wrapped
   in plastic wrap until firm, about 1 hour.
6. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper. Roll dough into balls and
   flatten slightly to 1 inch wide and about ½ an inch thick.
7. Roll each ball in more granulated sugar.
8. Make an indentation in the center of each cookie.
9. Fill indentations with jam (or chocolate if you like).
10. Bake until golden brown on edges, about 15-20 minutes.
11. Cool on baking sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to racks to cool
    completely.

## Provenance

Mom said she adapted this from a recipe in a magazine, so long ago we can't
figure out where.
