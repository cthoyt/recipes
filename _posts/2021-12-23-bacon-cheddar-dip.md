## Ingredients

- 1 lb bacon
- 2 medium white onions
- 8 oz. canned green chilies
- 2 big jalapeño peppers
- 1 28 oz. can whole peeled tomatoes (crushed)
- 1 lb shredded cheddar cheese
- Scallions (optional)

## Instructions

1. Chop bacon and cook to lightly crispy (keep the bacon grease)
2. Finely dice onions and sautée in 1 spoonful of bacon grease
3. After onions are translucent, add in the jalapeños and continue until they're soft
3. Strain the chilies (use a paper towel to get rest of the moisture out)
4. Combine onions, jalapeños, chilies, cheese, most of the bacon, and most of the tomato (don't overdo it otherwise it will be too wet)
5. Bake at 350℉ until it's bubbling (or until you know it to be done in your heart)
6. Garnish with remaining bacon and scallions

## Provenance
